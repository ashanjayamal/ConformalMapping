# Helical Domain

In an analogous manner, we shall find the answer to the question of univalent mapping of multiply connected domains onto a plane with cuts along arcs of logarithmic spirals and, as limiting cases, onto the plane with radial cuts and with cuts along circular arcs of concentric circles. 


For constant $\theta$ and $c$, the equation  $\Im(e^{-i\theta}\log(\xi))=c$ defines a logarithmic  spiral in the $\xi$-plane with asymptotic point at the origin.This spiral has the property that it is intersected by an arbitrary ray issuing from the origin at an angle $\theta$. This follows, for example, from the fact that if we shift to the plane $t = \log(\xi)$, this logarithmic spiral is mapped into the straight line $e^{-i\theta t} = c$ with inclination $\theta$ to the real axis, and the ray referred to is mapped into a straight line parallel to the real axis.

```





- For $\theta = 0$, the logarithmic spiral degenerates into a ray issuing from the origin. 
```{r echo=FALSE}
  knitr::include_graphics('figures/Helical_Domain/fig2.png')
```

```{python}
from sympy import *

# The Logrithm Arc depend on the Constant theta and c
theta=0
c=1

x, y = symbols('x y')

plot_implicit(log(x**2 + y**2)*sin(theta) + atan(y/x)*cos(theta) -c,
(x, -10, 10), (y, -10, 10))
```


- For $\theta = \frac{\pi}{2}$, it degenerates to a circle with center at the origin.

```{r echo=FALSE}
  knitr::include_graphics('figures/Helical_Domain/fig3.png')
```



```{python}
from sympy import *

# The Logrithm Arc depend on the Constant theta and c
theta=pi/2
c=2

x, y = symbols('x y')

plot_implicit(log(x**2 + y**2)*sin(theta) + atan(y/x)*cos(theta) -c,
(x, -10, 10), (y, -10, 10))
```

When we hold $c$ constant and vary $\theta$, we obtain various curves constituting the family of logarithmic spirals of inclination $\theta$. For all that follows, when we speak of logarithmic spirals of inclination $\theta$, these are what we mean. 

Let us show that, for any simply connected domain \(B\) that has boundary points, it is possible to map \(B\) onto the complex plane \(\mathbb{C}\) with a cut along an arc of a logarithmic spiral of inclination \(\theta\) in such a way that given points \(a\) and \(b\) of the domain \(B\) are mapped into \(0\) and \(\infty\), respectively. The expansion of the mapping function about \(z = b\) has the form:

\[ \frac{1}{z - b} +a_0+a_1{(z - b)} +\cdots\text{ or }  z+a_0+\frac{a_1}{z} +  + \cdots, \]

according as \(b\) is finite or infinite. 


- If domain \(B\) has **a single boundary point**,\
 this is obvious, and then the arc of the logarithmic spiral referred to degenerates to a point. 
 
- If the boundary of the domain \(B\) is **a continuum**,\
let us first map \(B\) conformally onto the domain \(\{z' : |z'| > 1\}\) in such a way that the point \(z = b\) is mapped into \(z' = \infty\). 





Let \(z'\) be the mapping function \(cP(z)\) in a neighborhood of \(z = b\). The expansion can be expressed as:

\[
z' = cP(z) = \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{1} (z - b) + \frac{1}{1!} (z - b)^2 + \frac{1}{0!} (z - b)^3 + \ldots
\]

or

\[
z' = cP(z) = \frac{1}{b} + \frac{1}{1}z + \frac{1}{1!}z^2 + \frac{1}{0!}z^3 + \ldots
\]

depending on whether \(b\) is finite or infinite. This expansion is possible due to Riemann's theorem.

Suppose that the point \(z = a\) is mapped into a point \(z' = a'\). Now, we need to establish the possibility of mapping the domain \(\lvert z' \rvert > 1\) onto the complex plane with a cut along a logarithmic spiral of inclination \(\epsilon\). This possibility follows from solving the problem related to the minimum of the quantity:

\[
 \Re(e^{-2i\theta} \log (F'(a))
\]

in the class I. This problem was studied in Section 3 of Chapter IV (the first application of Theorem 1 with \(a = \frac{17}{2} - \epsilon\)). It was shown that this problem has a solution, and the extremal function (normalized by the condition \(F(a') = 0\)) provides the required mapping. 

```{lemma}
Of all functions 
$$
\xi=F(z) := z + \frac{a}{z} + a_0 + \ldots
$$
that map the domain \(|z| > R\)  univalently in such a way that a given finite point \(a\) and the point \(\infty\) are 
mapped into the poi nts $0$ and \(\infty\) respectively, the quantity  \(\Re(e^{-2i\theta} \log (F'(a))\)
is minimized by the function $F_0(z)$ that maps the disk \(|z| > R\) onto the $\xi$-plane with cut along an arc of a logarithmic spiral of inclination $\theta$. Here $\log F '(z)$ means the brooch that approaches $0$ as $z \to \infty$. 
```

```{theorem}
 Every domain \(B\) in the \(z\)-plane can be mapped univalently onto a domain \(B'\) in the \(\omega\)-plane that includes the points 0 and \(\infty\), such that an arbitrary continuum of the complement of the domain \(B'\) with respect to the \(\omega\)-plane is an arc of a logarithmic spiral of given inclination \(\epsilon\). This mapping maps given points \(a\) and \(b\) of the domain \(B\) into 0 and \(\infty\), respectively, and the expansion of the mapping function about \(z = b\) has the form \((z - b)^{r_1} + a_0 + a_1 (z - b) + \ldots\) or \(z + a_0 + a_1 z^{-1} + \ldots\), according as \(b\) is finite or infinite.
