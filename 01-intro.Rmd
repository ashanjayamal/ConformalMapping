# UNIVALENT MAPPING OF MULTIPLY CONNECTED DOMAINS 
## Univalent conformal mapping of a doubly connected domain onto an annulus

### page 206

Let us now begin with the simplest case of the problem posed, namely, the 
case of doubly connected domains. Let us show that every doubly connected 
domain can be mapped univalently onto some circular annulus, whose boundary 
circles may degenerate to points. 

Let $B$ denote a doubly connected domain in the $z$-plane. 

If it has an isolated boundary point $z_0$, then, by adjoining it to the domain $B$, we obtain a simply connected domain that we can then map univalently either onto the disk $I (I < I)$ or onto the $(-$plane with the point $(= \infty)$ excluded. We can do this in such a way that the point $z = z_0$ is mapped into $(= 0)$. The domain $B$ is thus univalently mapped either onto the annulus $0 < |z| < I$ or onto the annulus $0 < |z| < \infty$.

Suppose now that the boundary of the domain $B$ consists of two continua $K_1$ and $K_2$. One of these, let us say $K_1$ is necessarily bounded. The complement of $K_1$ in the $z$-plane is an open set consisting of two disjoint domains. One of these domains, let us say $B_1$ contains the domain $B$. The domain $B_1$ is simply connected. Therefore, it can be mapped conformally onto the disk $|z'| < I$. Under this mapping, the continuum $K_2$ is mapped into a continuum $K$ contained in $|z' | < I$, and the domain $B$ is mapped into a domain $B'$. 

Let us now map whichever of the simply connected domains complementary to $K$ contains $B'$ onto the domain $|z''| > I$ in such a way that $z' = \infty$ is mapped into $z'' = \infty$. Under this mapping, the circle $|z'| = I$ is mapped into an analytic Jordan curve contained in the domain $|z''| > I$ and the domain $B'$ is mapped into a doubly connected domain $B''$ that does not include $\infty$ and that is bounded by this curve and by the circle $|z''| = I$. 

The composite of these two mappings constitutes a univalent mapping of the domain $B$ onto the domain $B''$. Furthermore, on the basis of $\S 3$ of Chapter II, we conclude that this mapping sets up a one-to-one correspondence between the prime ends of the domain $B$ and the boundary points of the domain $B''$. Here, just as in $\S 3$ of Chapter II, by the prime end of the domain $B$ that corresponds to the point $z$ on the boundary of the domain $B''$, we mean the set of all cluster points of all sequences of points of the domain $B$ that approach the boundary point $z$.
